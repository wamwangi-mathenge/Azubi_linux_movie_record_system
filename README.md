# A Linux Movie-record System

The objective of this project is to create a Movie-Record System on a Linux operating system and utilize Git and GitHub for version control. By following the instructions below, students will gain hands-on experience in Linux file management, Git versioning, and repository setup.

- Install a Linux operating system of their choice on a virtual machine or on own computer.
- Use your knowledge of Linux file types and hierarchy to create a Movie-record system. A folder that will contain 2 sub-directories (movies & series)
- The sub-directories would then contain movie-series names e.g. moviex, seriesy...
Use basic Linux commands and file navigations to create, edit, move, and delete files and directories in your Movie-record system.
- Create a GitHub repository to store your Movie-record system and version your changes.
- Use Git to push and pull changes to and from your GitHub repository.
